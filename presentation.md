# Thesis

* My thesis project is a visual style for my own made up political satire party. Ambitions of the made up party aren't to get into local politics but to reflect on local problems of Prague, such as cars parked on sidewalks, shortage of living etc. The aim is to bring attention to these problems through various satirical marketing performances that will happen on the streets of Prague 10 Vrsovice. The reason why I chose this part of Prague is because it's a part of Prague I grew up in and know well and it's a place that has the most streets that are bare the name after world countries. Country street names are crucial to my party because it's satirical aim is to create "Peace in the world" through these various performances happening on the streets. 

# Platform

* The party has it's own platform made up of 12 performances for each street that contains a country name. Each point has a satirical problem that is accompanied with a real solution. Each point in the platform is presented as nonsense but it actually represents an actial local problem of Prague. The party's name is "Uličníci" which can be roughly translated to "Rascals". "Ulice" in Czech can also translated to "streets". The name has a double meaning in itself. The party has it's own logo and other various promotional materials such as an umbrella or a poster. The umbrella would be used for various humorous performances. The party describes itself as a satirical movement that isn't meant to be taken seriously. 

## Performances

* The performance would include an actor or any theater group that would like take part in the project. The first point in the platform focuses on shortage of living and would take place at Slovenian street. The name of the performance would be called Slovexit and would focus on a satirical goal of getting rid of Slovaks from Slovenian street so there would be enough space for living. An actor could play a stereotypical Slovak person that would be running down the street symbolising the exit. The next performance for Kazakh street would be focues on the problem of cars wasting too much space on the street so there would be a competition to choose the next dictator of Kazakh street that would force all the car owners to move out of the street. 

# Visual style

* Each performance will have it’s own promotional materials that will be used to communicate with the public. Promotional materials would contain things such as posters, brochures, platform brochure and other merchandising materials such as t-shirts and badges for each perfromance so the people could identify themselves with the movement and the streets it’s preforming on.  It’s important for those visuals to include some shock value to get people’s attention. The first two performances will be dedicated to Slovinská street and Kazašská street. In English, the street names can be traslated to Slovenian street and Kazakh street. The poster for Slovenian street would contain colours of the Slovenian flag and poster for Kazakh street would contain colours of the Kazakh flag. The posters would contain stereotypical humorous picrograms of people representing the country the streets are named after in a humorous style. After a certain period the style of the posters would change to one single exclamation mark that would be used as an identification symbol for the movement. 

## Logo 

* The logo would be made up of the party's name and would be in a neutral black colour so it can distinguish itself from other movement and party logo's in the Czech Republic. The logo includes an exclamation mark at the end to symbolize something radical, crazy and unusual. 

## Brochures 

* Brochures would contain a call to action in the form of a facebook icon and an Instagram icon, where viewers would be encouraged to look up the movement’s Facebook and Instagram accounts. However, platform brochures would be available as well, where people can read about the whole platform and upcoming performances. Each brochure would have the colour of the country's flag the street is named after, just like the posters. Brochures could be handed out to people or they could be distributed in stacks through which people could then take a brochure from. 

## Flags 

* Each performance would have it's own flag that would be hanged up on a pole. The flag would contain a pictogram of a person representing the country's nation in a humorous way in a similar style as the brochures and posters and each performance would have it's own flag. The flags would be used in a separate performance after the main one and would mark the end of each performance in the specified street. 

# Strategy 

* The aim of the party is to get to more mainstream attention through satirical performances that will help the movement grow. The strategy contains an online and an outdoor communication through posters and a party platform with online communication focused on introducing the party platform through Facebook posts.  

## Facebook 

* Facebook would be used a source of information for the viewers, where they could find the meaning of the performance. The explanation would contain a description of the platform point, where viewers could read about the performance in deeper detail such as reasoning behind the performance and the outcomes of fit. After the end of each performance a post would be made to mark the end of each performance.

## Instagram

* Instagram would be used in a similar manner like Facebook with photos from the performances included.
